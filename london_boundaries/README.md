## Greater London Area

The area/boundary of Greater London, governed by the Greater London Authority (GLA) and with most transport services specified or supplied by Transport for London. Local government is formed of the 32 boroughs of Greater London, and the City of London Corporation. This geospatial file shows the area encompassing all 33. It is also the area in which London's LEZ, CCZ and TRLN are all contained. 

##  London Congestion Charge Zone

The area and boundary of central London where a Congestion Charge is levied on certain vehicles (e.g. private cars) entering during the main part of weekdays. Source Shapefile and MapInfo file from http://roads.data.tfl.gov.uk/

##  London Low Emission Zones

Area of the London Low Emission Zone (2008) and Ultra Low Emission Zones (2019 and 2021), as defined by Transport for London. Original source Shapefile/MapInfo/PDFs available at http://roads.data.tfl.gov.uk/

The LEZ is converted directly from the shapefile. It is close to the Greater London Boundary and applies to trucks and other heavy vehicles, since 2008. It is marked by white signs with a green circle.

The ULEZ (2019) is also converted from the shapefile. It is the same as the London Congestion Charge Zone (approximately the eastern half of Zone 1) and is marked with green signs with a white circle.
The ULEZ (2021) has been extracted and manually georeferenced from a PDF on the TfL website. It is just inside the North Circular and South Circular roads, which traditionally separate inner and outer London from a transport modelling perspective. The preview below shows the ULEZ (2021).

## Transport for London Road Network

The area and boundary of the "Transport for London Road Network" (TLRN), also known as London's Red Routes. This is a set of polygons, split by London borough, showing the area of London's road network that is controlled by TfL, instead of each borough itself. These roads typically have lines on the side painted in red rather than yellow. Original source at http://roads.data.tfl.gov.uk/. Up to date as of July 2017.
