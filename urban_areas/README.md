The boundaries used on CDRC Maps to show urban areas. CDRC Maps uses three levels of urban extent
boundaries, of which two are included here (the third, which is based on OS Vector Map District is extremely
large, so is not included).

Great Britain:
Zoom levels 7, 8 and 9: str14_urbanareas (OS Open Data Strategi urban regions)
Zoom levels 10 and 11: str16_largeurbanareas_buff (OS Open Data Strategi urban regions)
Zoom levels 12+: vmd18_building (Vector Map District buildings)

Northern Ireland:
Zoom levels 7, 8 and 9: nisra_urbanareas
Zoom levels 10 and 11: nisra_urbanareas
Zoom levels 12+: OpenStreetMap buildings

str14/16 = Strategi from late 2013 and mid 2016 respectively.

The Large urban areas are the large polygons from Strategi urban regions only, and buffered outwards
slightly, compared with the urba areas. Both differences can be seen on the image here.
Note that Strategi urban regions are almost identical to Meridian 2 DLUAs, just buffered slightly differently.
